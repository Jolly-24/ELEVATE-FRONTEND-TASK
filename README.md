Thats simple e-commerce products listing page:
1- Using Fake Store API to get products and categories data.
2- I used daisyUI to get Tailwind components as navbar and footer
3- I used jQuery to make reload function when api is ready
4- Used npm to install Tailwind and daisyUI

To run the application you will need to download node to use npm to install the using dependencies that you will found them in package.json file.
